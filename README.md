# Threat Detection & Response Using Microsoft 365 Defender.  

This project demonstrates a simulated enterprise security setup using Microsoft 365 E5 Developer Tenant and Azure Free Tier resources. The primary goal is to illustrate threat detection and response capabilities, apply Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, explore Microsoft Sentinel's capabilities, and focus on compliance and hardeningâ€”all within the constraints of free-tier services.
