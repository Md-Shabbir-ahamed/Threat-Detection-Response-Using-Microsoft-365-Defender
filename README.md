# Threat Detection & Response Using Microsoft 365 Defender.  

This project demonstrates a simulated enterprise security setup using Microsoft 365 E5 Developer Tenant and Azure Free Tier resources. The primary goal is to illustrate threat detection and response capabilities, apply Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, explore Microsoft Sentinel's capabilities, and focus on compliance and hardening—all within the constraints of free-tier services.

# Project Objectives. 

* Simulate Threats: Detect and respond to simulated threats, specifically phishing attacks, using Microsoft 365 Defender.
* Focus on Compliance & Hardening: Explore compliance posture and data loss prevention (DLP) features available through the Compliance Manager.
* Apply IAM Policies: Implement foundational Identity and Access Management policies with Azure Active Directory (Free Tier).
* Explore SIEM-lite: Utilize Microsoft Sentinel (within its free ingestion limits) for basic log analytics and security information and event management (SIEM) capabilities.
* Leverage Free Resources: Accomplish all objectives exclusively using Microsoft's free developer and Azure free-tier programs.

###  Set Up Microsoft 365 Developer E5 Tenant
1. Go to: [Microsoft 365 Developer Program]. 
2.  Sign up and choose **“Instant Sandbox”** 
3.  This will grant access to:
    * Microsoft 365 Defender
    * 25 dummy users
    * Azure AD Free Tier
    * Compliance Center

  ###  Set Up an Azure Free Account

1.  Go to: [Azure Free Account]. 
2.  Sign up using the  email. 
3.  Access to Always-free services (e.g., Log Analytics workspace, Azure AD Free, Azure Functions).

###  Simulate a Phishing Attack via Defender

1.  Navigate to: [Microsoft 365 Security Portal]. 
2.  Go to **Attack Simulation Training**.
3.  Create a **Phishing Campaign** targeting 3–5 of your dummy users.
4.  Monitor and track the results:
    * User click rates on the phishing links.
    * Microsoft Defender's detection capabilities. 
    * Any auto-remediation actions taken by Defender.
  
###  Enable Microsoft Sentinel (Free Ingestion)

1.  In the Azure Portal, create a new **Log Analytics Workspace**.
2.  Enable **Microsoft Sentinel** on the newly created workspace.
3.  Connect the following data connectors:
    * **Microsoft 365 Defender** logs
    * **Azure Activity Logs**
4.  Create a simple analytics rule to demonstrate basic SIEM functionality:
    * Rule name: "Phishing Click Event"
    * Trigger: Based on logs indicating a phishing click detected by Defender.
    * Action: Configure an email alert to notify relevant personnel.
  

 ## Compliance & Hardening Insights.
 
  * Compliance Score Analysis. 
  * Initial score. 

## Key areas for improvement identified:

  * DLP Policy Testing. 

## Scenario for data exfiltration simulation:

  * Alerts generated by DLP. 

## Information Protection Labels. 

  * How labels could be used to protect data involved in the simulation.
